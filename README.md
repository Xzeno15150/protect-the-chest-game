# Protect the Chest Game

This project is a game project that I had to do in my Conception Course.

## Subject of the Project

In groups of **2** we had to create a game of the type of our choice with few constraints :

- Use Java with JavaFX for the graphic part
- Do not use any external libraries 
- Implements a game loop using a Thread

## What is it ?

You play a character with a gun, that have to protect a chest on the bottom of the map.
You can move in 8 different directions, but can only shoot to the top.
Your goal is to survive as long as possible.

Each enemy killed make another appeared in a random position and increase you kill count.
Ennemies try to touch you chest. If they touch either you or the chest, you lost a life.
When you have lost 3 lives, the game stop on GameOver, and the best score is updated if it has to.
